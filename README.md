# Forked Project
This is a forked project on Ultimate Notes Books Resources for NCIT.

This may never merged to the original project

## What's New / Updated

Maintaining a server may not be possible, so looking for any solution which can have the search feature with just client side JS.

All the note resoures are taken, saved on a file (refrences) (createFileTags.js, will look throught the dirs and collect files details and save in files.js)
index.html refrence the files.js and can search based on tags (dirs, file names) [Search on client side]

## Improvemnt
Need improvement on search.
